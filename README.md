## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a research and teaching assistant at the [Wagner Lab](https://www.isabellawagner.com/people) and the [SCAN-Unit](https://scan-psy.univie.ac.at/). My responsibilities include the collection and analysis of fMRI data, as well as teaching practical sessions in a class on fMRI data analysis. Currently, I am working on a project focused on thalamic functional connectivity in relation to APOE genotype and on a graph-theoretical analysis of the human navigation network. I am passionate about learning new things, programming, and making science more accessible.
